AWS S3 Lifecycle rules
----------------------

Automaticalling does the following things 
->Changing the Storage Class 
->Expiring the object

By using these two transion we can go for life cycle rule

S3 standard

S3 Standard IA

s3Intelligient -tiering

S3 one Zone -IA

S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval

S3 glacier Flexibal Retrieval

S3 Glacier Deep Archive

Here we can change the storage class from s3 stanadrd to S3 standard 1a/s3Intelligient -tiering/S3 one Zone -IA/S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval/S3 glacier Flexibal Retrieval/S3 Glacier Deep Archive

Hre In the same way -s3Intelligient -tiering/S3 one Zone -IA/S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval/S3 glacier Flexibal Retrieval/S3 Glacier Deep Archive

3rd -S3 one Zone -IA/S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval/S3 glacier Flexibal Retrieval/S3 Glacier Deep Archive

4th - /S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval/S3 glacier Flexibal Retrieval/S3 Glacier Deep Archive

5th - S3 glacier Flexibal Retrieval/S3 Glacier Deep Archive

Like this we can forward selection of storage classes
but from S3 Glacier Deep aechive to S3 stanadrdd we cannot go (backward process isn ot there) 


steps:

Create Lifecycle rule ->Lifecycle rule name ->Choose a rule scope )like apply to all objects /limit the scope)
->Life cycle rule action
check the below actions  as oer the convient

Move current versions of objects between storage classes
Move noncurrent versions of objects between storage classes
Expire current versions of objects
Permanently delete noncurrent versions of objects


->Provide the Transition current versions of objects between storage classes
From which storage class to what storage class

->for non current versions alsoo -> provide the info if needed ->Transition noncurrent versions of objects between storage classes
->with in how many days need to deleted the object provide info ->Expire current versions of objects
->create rule
