AWS S3 -Storage Clasess
-----------------------
When we upload a object in bucket we have the storage class

We have muliple storage sclass
Based on access the pattern we have the storage class(like how frequently we access the files)

S3 Satndard->Frequently accessed data (more than once a month) with milliseconds access - availability zones (>=3) it maintained 3 copies of this file in backend

Standard-IA -Infrequently accessed data (once a month) with milliseconds access - availability zones (>=3) it maintained 3 copies of this file in backend

One Zone-IA -Recreatable, infrequently accessed data (once a month) stored in a single Availability Zone with milliseconds access - availability zones (1) it maintained 1 copies of this file in backend

For Glacier - we need to restore and have to access

Glacier Instant Retrieval - can access only once a quarter -0 Long-lived archive data accessed once a quarter with instant retrieval in milliseconds availability zones (>=3) it maintained 3 copies of this file in backend

Glacier Flexible Retrieval (formerly Glacier) -Long-lived archive data accessed once a year with retrieval of minutes to hours - availability zones (>=3) it maintained 3 copies of this file in backend

Glacier Deep Archive -Long-lived archive data accessed less than once a year with retrieval of hours -availability zones (>=3) it maintained 3 copies of this file in backend

Glacier Data retrival :

Bulk retrieval : Typically with in 5-12 hours
Standard retrieval  : Typically within 3-5 hours.
Expedited retrieval :typically within 1-5 min when retieving less than 250 MB



Reduced redundancy -Not recommended -Noncritical, frequently accessed data with milliseconds access (not recommended as S3 Standard is more cost effective)
