Terraform Workspace
===================
=>No.of resources can run parrallely without destroying the previous resource

=> Here we have two environments and we have created stage.tfvars and prod.tfvars
In stage.tfvars we have instance type and environment_name
and in the same second way too
Here if we want to do run any one we want to destroy the that previous terraform and then run the second env_name var file

=> So by using the terraform workspace we can run both the resources

	=>In main.tf
	=> In terraform if we want create wprkspace  we use locals block

	=>terraform init
	=>terraform workspace list
		* default
	now create the new workspace and switch to stage workspace from default 
	terraform workspce new <workspace name>
	=>terraform workspace new stage
	=>terraform workspace list
		default
	      * stage
	=>terraform workspace new prod (it will create prod workspace and switch to prod workspace)
	=>terraform workspace list
	        default
	        stage
	       * prod
	 =>terraform workspace show (it will show the prsent workspace)
		prod
	=>terraform workspace select stage (it wiil switch specified workspace)
	=>terraform plan -var-file="stage.tfavrs"
	=>terrfaorm apply -var-file="stage.tfvars" --auto-approve
	Now without destrying the previpus resource we will run the other resource by shifting thw workspace
	=>terraform workspace show
		stage
	=>terraform workspace select prod
	=>terraform workspace show
		prod
	=>terraform plan -var-file="prod.tfvars"
	=>terrfaorm apply -var-file="prod.tfvars"

=>to delete the workspace we use
	terrform workspace delete stage
