Jenkins Deployement Project -Manually
====================================

1.Launch the EC2 instance -Jenkins Server
2. Git clone
3. Maven build
4. Deploy the war file in apache tomcat server

Now First

1. Through EC2 instance create a jenkins server
	->launach an instance
	->open through putty
	->to install jenkins we need java so install java
	->sudo amazon-linux-extras install java-openjdk11 -y
	->check java -version
	->install jenkins repositority and key from redhat package manager
	-> sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
         sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
	->systemctl status jenkins
	->systemctl restart jenkins
	->then unlock the jenkins

2. Git clone [Create a job in jenkins] 

	-> FreestyleProject -JobName <JenkinsDeploymentProject>
	->Source code Management - give the url of spring project for Eg:https://github.com/iominh/SpringMVC.git
	->apply and save
	->come to putty and install git
	->sudo yum install git
	->now run the job should display success

3.Maven build 
	->to build maven we need install maven in putty
	->to install maven we need stanadard version of java
	->sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk -y
	->java -version
	->sudo yum install maven -y
	->mvn --version
	->NOW  go to jenkins tool
	->Manage Jenkins - Tools -Maven installation - add maven
	->Name  : Maven3
	->MAVEN_HOME : /usr/share/maven (the path can be displayed in mvn version command)
	->apply and save
	-> Now go to that job
	->click on configure
	-> Build Steps : choose Invote top-level Maven targets
	-> Maven version - select the added maven versiom
	->Goals - give the command - clean package - which the create the war file
	->apply and save
	->run the job should display SUCCESS 

4. Deploy the war file in apache tomcat server

	-> To deploy the war file in tomcat server we need one more instance that apache tomcat server
	->so luamch the server -amazaon linux kernal - name as apache tomcat server
	->To install tomcat server we need java v
	->sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk -y
	->check java -version
	-> get the tomcat tar file from dlcdn website 
	-> in bin folder get the file apache-tomcat-9.0.80.tar.gz

	->use to install the tomcat - wget https://downloads.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.80/bin/apache-tomc                                                                                                         at-9.0.80.tar.gz
	-> untar the tomcatserver file
	->tar -zxvf apache-tomcat-9.0.80.tar.gz
	-> remove the tar file
	-> rm -rf apache-tomcat-9.0.80.tar.gz
	->Now one untar file is present 
	-> cd apache-tomcat-9.0.80
	->ll
	->cd webapps
	->ll
	->cd manager
	->ll
	->cd META-INF
	->ll

	   <role rolename ="manager-script"/>
	   <user username ="tomcat" password ="tomcat" roles = "manager-gui,manager-script" />
	->save and exit the file
	->Now get out of the directory 
	->cd apache-tomcat-9.0.80
	->ll
	->cd bin
	->ll
	->now the start the server apache tomcat server
	->./startup.sh
	->now to go the apache tomcatserver instance ip address followed by 8080
	-> it will launach the website and give the tomcat the credentials


	->Now to go jenkins job
	->configure
	->Build steps
	->post build action: choose : Deploy  war/ear to a container
	->WAR/EAR files :**/*.war
-	->Context path(which will display in website path) :springmvc3
	->Containers
	->Credentials :tomcat user and password
	->Tomcat URL :http://13.235.76.47:8080/
