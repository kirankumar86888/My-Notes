AWS Services :
==============
server-are the computers which serve the services to serve needs of other computer

Types of services
-----------------------
1.Web server:aapache server (httpd),nginx server ,iis(used in windows OS)
2.Application server :aapache tomcat server,f5nginx,ibm sphere

Virtual Machine :
-----------------

In single OS- we use multiple OS

EC2 -  Elastic Compute Cloud
-Web service that provide security and resizable computer capacity
-Region based service
-it is used for virtual machine
-based on our requirement services/instance are resizable
-Minimum billing period is 1 hr

To create an EC2 instance - had 7 steps

1.Choose AMI(Amazon Machine Image) - It is template contains software configuaration (like Os) required to ur instance
						-we have different types of instanses
						-region specific service(it has own Id)
						- simply AMI is OS
						
2.Instance Type configure - like t2.micro contains CPU and Memory (t2.micro- free )
3.Instance Details configure
				- with same OS multiple instances can be created
4. Storage configure  - by defualt it provided some ram based on instance and more than that it is payable

5.Add tags 
			for naming convention 
6.Security group - just like firewall which control traffic of instance
			-INBOUND
			-OUTBOUND
			-region specific service
			- a created security group can be used for multiple OS
 			-SSH(SECURED SOCKET HOST) - PORT -22 used in linux env
			-HHTP()-80
			-HHTPS()-443
FOR compueter - VPC(VIRTUAL PRIVATE CLOUD) - WHICH PROVIDES NETWORKING
A KEY PAIR IS NEEDED TO CONNECT TO SERVER
	-COMBINATION OF PUBLIC(AWS) & PRIVATE KEY(USER)
	-.PEM FORMAT (PRIVATE KEY WILL BE IN .PEM FORMAT)
	-SAME KEYPAIR cann be used for any OS based on virtual machine

to connect server we use different tools
-PUTTY
-GITBASH
-MOBAXTERM
-WINSCP
-SUPER PUTTY

------------------------------------------------------

We need to create ec2Instance through GitBash,Putty,MobaxTerm
