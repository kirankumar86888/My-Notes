AWS VPC-3
---------
To provide the internet in private server 

Sow we use NAT gateways(nat gatweay instanve it is outadated)

Nat gateways - create nat gateway - select the public subnet - connectivity -public- elastic IP(assign) - create nat gatweay



So now we need to add route tablle in private route table
route -edit routes- add rote - all traffic(0.0.0.0/0) - nat gaetway -save changes
---
the other way to coonect the internet in private server
NAT Instance ( launach Instance - community AMIS - nat ami,)
Let us launch instance -for public subnet -private server - ami nat - t3 micro - public subnet- vpc- let us create security group(http.https) - anywhere- luanch instance - then only it works

To allow the network from outside to side this must
nat instance -action - networking - change source and destination -save

route tables - private route table - edir routes- add route - 0.0.0.0./0- target - Instance - Nat instance -save



----
app subnet server need to connect with the local laptop 
so we create the load balancer to do this 

-create load balancer - 

first - target group - tar get group name - select vpc - app server attach - create group

create load balncer -application load balancer - name - vpc - ataach the public two subnets (load balancer runs in the public subnet)
create a security group for load balancer - created

Now using load balancer dns name  we will connect the instance 


Network ACL :

to filter the uneccessary traffic we 
- we have by default - 6 subnets

create network acl - name - vpc attach -create
now add two public subnets and add in network acl
and add inbound(http,https,rdp,ssh)(temporarily ports can be added 1024- 65535) and outbound rules(http,https,rdp,ssh)(temporarily ports can be added 1024- 65535) i network acl 

lowest rule number highest pripority
