AWS VPC-4
---------


Private subnet - wothout using Nat gateway or Nat instance

Need to provide the S3 bucket access

By using Endpoints(without intterne we can provide access for S3,dynamo DB)
`-Mulitpile Endpints are there
	1.VPC Endpoint/Gateway Endpoint - free data transfer cost (aws manages)
	2.Interface Endpoint - by inetrface traffic is charges

1.Endpoint - Services - ServiceName - Type (Gateway/Interface)
Select Gateway
2.Select VPC
3.Route Table - Pricate Route table
4.Policy - full access
 then click on create end point

Now in private route table - a end point is added



VPC Peering
-------------
Allow us to enable communication betwwen multiple VPC'ss (same Region,Diff region,Different aws account VPC's)


	Requestor VPC - Creating VPC
	Acceptor VPC -Accessing VPC
->The Requestor VPC and Accepting VPC should not be in same range (IP address(CIDR range-IPV4)) for the communication establishment
->VPC Peering is not tansitive peering
->Update both the VPCs route tables with another VPC CIDR blocks via peering connection

Let us create an Instance- with defualt vpc
For EG - Mumbai VPc
	 Hyd- VPc 


	 	Requestor VPC (HyD) 	Acceptor VPC (Mumbai)
VPC CIDR	 192.16.8.0.0./21	10.0.0.0/16
VPC ID 		vpc-78786876		vpc-jhg787hg786
Region		ap-south-2		ap-south-1	
ACC ID		6756756757		6756756757

Let us create peering connection in Requestor VPC
1.Name
2.Select a local VPC to peer with -created requstor vpc
3.Select another vpc to peer with -(same account or another account), Same region or another region select it(mumbai VPC and VPC Id) then create peering connection

Now status it will show pending acceptance for Requestor VPC

Now we have to got to the mumbai vpc - slect the vpc- action -accept request
Now peering connectivity is done

For communication we have to do

In hyd region - rouute table - should add mumbai vpc CIDR via private route(select any route table)
Edit routes- add route - paste cidr of mumbai target - peering connection - save changes

In Mumbai region - rouute table - should add hyd vpc CIDR via private route(select any route table)
Edit routes- add route - paste cidr of hyd target - peering connection - save changes
