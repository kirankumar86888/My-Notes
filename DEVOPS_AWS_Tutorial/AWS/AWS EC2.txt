AWS EC2
--------
1.Elastic Compute Cloud
2.It is the most demanded service
3.EC2 is used to create the virtual machines(EC2 instances)/Virtual server
4.EC2 instances are resizable (the instance type - increase or decrease like ram capicity , hardisk..etc)
5.EC2 is the region specific service
6.EC2 instance minimum billing period is 1 hour 
7.EC2 is a paid service, t2 micro service is free tiere
8.Free tier eligible for 1 year , and for 1month - 750 hours
9.AWS will provide defualt storage and network
10.For storage purpose we use Elastic Block Store Volumes(EBS)-hardisk
	for Linux  - they 8gb by default
	for windows - 30 gb by defualt
	max size they provide is - 16 terra bytes
11.For Network they use VPC(Virtual Private Network) 
12.For Intsance for securily connectiion we use KeyPairs - Public key or private key (.PEM and .ppk)
13.EC2 istancees has the security Groups - Will control the incomming and outgoing traffic we configure INBOUND and OUTBOUND RULES
  for Linux -	For SSH- port no -22
	        For HTTP-port no --80
		For HTTPS -port no --443
 for Windows
		For RDP -port no -3389

14.One security group can be used in differenct instances

15.EC2 Instances Types
	a. On demand Instances - Fixed Price(for hourlsy bases) - pay for use
	b.Reserved instances-Adavance booking - long term commitment(1,2, 3 years)- Provides the discount 
	c.spot instances - Like bidding process (High capacity for low prices) velampata
	4.dedicated instances - this is pyhsical machine - very very costly-licence based software
		
16.by using the Bootsrap script we can launch the instance
	In BootStrap script while luanching the only we will create the script for task and get the results
	In advance setting - in launch instance - User data -
		write the shell scrpt
		#!/bin/bash
		sudo su
		yum update -y
		yum install httpd -y
		cd /var/www/html
		echo "Amazon Web Services">index.html
		service httpd start
		chkconfig https on
	and luanch the instance
	We can see the results in website of using the ip address
	after stoppping the instances only we can modifying the user data	


ELASTIC IP
==========
	Elastic IP is Stactic IP address
	1.IP is Internet Protocol
	We have different types of IP
		1.Private IP
		2.Public IP
		3.Elastic IP
	2.Normally when we start and stop the instances the public IP address will get changed whwere as the private IP address is not changed
	3.Elastic IP is used billing is generated
	EC2 dashboard -ELastic IP - Allocate Elastic IP - generate- type public IP
		Now associate the Elastic IP - here select the instance we have launched - now it will assign the standard IP address to created instance(webserver)

		Now when stop and start the instances the public IP address will not get changed


ADD USER :
=========
Default user - EC2 user we use to login the putty server

By our name also we can login into ec2 instance

->In putty 
	sudo useradd madhu
	sudo su - madhu
	mkdir .ssh
	ls -la
	cd .ssh
	touch authorized_keys
