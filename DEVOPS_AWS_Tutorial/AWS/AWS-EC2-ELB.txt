AWS-EC2-ELB
===========
1.If we deploy our application in one server then burden will increased on that server
2.Load Balancer - here we use application on multiple servers 
to implement we use ELB in AWS
	here we use Round Robbin Algorithm
	Take the req from the users and sent the req to different multiple servers

3.ELB is different types
	a.application Load Balancer- here we use two types of http and https port it will run nad we need create the "Target Group " server- it is the group of servers which are running in our application
	then automatically a DNS name will created
By using DNS we access our application 
	EC2- Create for eg 2 instances
		1.VPC - subnet - 1 availaibility zone say is-east-1a
		2.VPC - subnet - 2nd availability zone say-us-east-1b
	after creating 2 instances
	Now create a target groyp - add the 2 servers containg the application
	Select Load Balancers - Application Load Balancer -select the avaialbility zones and target group and create
 		then automatically a DNS name will created
By using DNS name we access our application 



	b.Network Load Balancer
	c.Gateway Load Balancer
	d.Classic Load Balancer(retired aug 15 2020)
