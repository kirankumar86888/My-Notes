AWS -VPC
===========
=>VPC stand for Virtual Private Cloud
=>VPC is one of the AWS customer managed service
=>VPC is free service
=>For every AWS root account one default VPC will be provided by AWS Cloud
=>Based on the requirement we can create on our own VPC
=>VPC will provide isolated network for cloud services
=> to luanch the virtual server we need
	RAM
	core processor
	EBS volumes(Elastic Block Storage)
	HDD (Hard desk)
	VPC (for network)
=> VPC the components required are
	subnets
	route tables
	Internet gateway	
	VPC Sizing

For Eg we have : Compund wall and has a main gate
	-> Inside that we have main door
	->Inside the house we have 4 rooms
	->each room is connected to another room by doors (subnets)
->Subnets :the rooms are called as subnets
->Public Subnets : the room which the resource can enter
->Private subnets : no able to enter into all the rooms
->Routing tables: conection for all the rooms (doors)
->Internet gateway : Can approach the main gate


SUBNET : Breaking the large network into smaller networks
PUBLIC SUBNETS : the subnet which has internet connection
PRIVATE SUBNETS: the subnet which doesnot have the internet connection

We can create per region 5 VPC's (and can extend to 100 VPC's)
We can create 200 subnets for one VPC

IP address: Internet Protocol
	->it is considered as address
	->for every machine IP address is mandatory

IP address can be two categorized
	->IPv4 and IPv6

IPv4- 32 bit address format (for eg : 10.0.0.1)	
	here we have 4 parts
	every octect(part) have 8 bits
	total size= 32 bits (4*8)

IPv6- it containes alphanumeric (for eg :192.ewwer.ewrwe)
	here we have 8 parts
	every octects(part) have 16 bits
	total size = 128 bits (16* 8)

VPC Sizing :

	It is the process of allocating IP address for the VPC
For Eg:IPv4 CIDR (172.31.0.0/16) -classless Inter Domain Range
	/16 -> indicates range of IP address
10.0.0.0/16=>2 power (32-16)= 2^16 = 65536
10.0.0.0/32=2 power(32-32)= 1
10.0.0.0/28 = 2 power(32-28) = 2^4 =16

When we install the the aws provide default VPC
Now let us create a own VPC

Create VPC
	select VPC only
name tag -myVPC
IPv4 CIDR(28.0.0.0/16) range specifybased on the requirement


cleck on create VPC

when we craete the vpc automatically a private route table is getting craeted by default

now let us create the subnets

public subnet
private subnet
