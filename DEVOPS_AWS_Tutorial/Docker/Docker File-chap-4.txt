Docker File
===========
	=>Docker file is a text document that contains commands that are used to assemble/create an image
	=>Docker file contains instructions to build dockeer image
	=>In Docker file we will use DSL Language (Domain Specific Language) a set of Keywords
	=>Docker Engine(server) will process docker file instructions to buils docker image
	=> To create a docker file - D should capital Letter compulsory (Dockerfile.txt)
	=>First we will create a docker file ->in that we have a keywords and we create a image(docker pull) from that we will create a container(docker run)

KeyWords : all keywords are in CAPITAL LETTER

	1.FROM : it represent base image to create our own image
	2.MAINTAINER: it reprsent name of the organization or author that who created the docker file (optional)
	3.CMD : it reprsents the intial command and that should be executed when the container starts(linux commands)
	4.RUN :It reprsent to runs linux comamnds with in the container , generally helps for installing the software/running the linux commands [RUN yum install maven]
	5.ADD: It used  to add the files from host machine to conatiner,it is used to download the packages from internet
	6.COPY : It used  to add the files from host machine to conatiner
	7.USER : it is used to provide the info of logged user
	8.WORKDIR :it is used to specify the defualt working directory inside the container
	9.EXPOSE : it is used to specify the internal port of the container
	10.ENTRYPOINT : It will instruct, it exceutes whenever the container runs
	11.ENV :It is used to set the Environment variable(assigning the variables) like key value pairs

Eg:
	create a file Dockerfile
	=>vim Dockerfile
		FROM nginx
		MAINTAINER madhu
		CMD ["echo" "myfirstimage"]
save and exit
	=>Now create a docker image from base image
	    docker build -t Mynginx .
		(docker build -t(tag) <myownimage) and the path(.) root directory)

	=>Now create a docker container from image
		docker run -it mynginx 

clone the source code
in host machine avialble all files

vim docker 
from /home/ec2-user/hello-world-java 
copy hello-world-java 
run java compile


1. Dockerfile
-----------------
FROM ubuntu
MAINTAINER Madhu
RUN apt-get update -y
RUN apt-get install python3 -y
CMD ["echo" ,"eneterd into container......"]
CMD ["echo" ,"eneterd into container......"]
CMD ["echo" ,"eneterd into container......"]
CMD ["echo" ,"eneterd into container......"]
CMD ["echo" ,"eneterd into container......"]
CMD ["echo" ,"eneterd into container......"]
ENTRYPOINT echo "I aam Madhu"
CMD ["echo" ,"eneterd into container......10"]
ENTRYPOINT echo "I aam Madhu"
ENTRYPOINT echo "I aam Madhu"
ENTRYPOINT echo "I aam Madhu"
ENTRYPOINT echo "I aam Madhu"
ENTRYPOINT echo "I aam Madhu"


Last entrypoint will be run in the container

2.Dockerfile

ARG NGINX_VERSION = latest
FROM NGINX:${NGINX_VERSION}
ADD index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
WORKDIR /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
CMD ["nginx", "-g" ,"daemon off;"]
EXPOSE 80
LABEL maintainer ="Madhu"
ENV APP_VERSION =1.0
