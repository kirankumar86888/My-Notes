-What steps would you take to secure containers
	1.Use Distro less or images with not too many packages as your final image in multi stage build , sotheat there is less chance of CVE or security issues

	2.Ensure that the networking is configured properly.This is one of the most common reasons for security issues. If required configure custom bridge network and assign them to isolate containers

	3.Use utilities like Sync to scan your containet images (will have no vulverabilities)
