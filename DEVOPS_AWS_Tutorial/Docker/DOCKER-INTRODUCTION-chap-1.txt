Docker Introduction
===================
=> In Docker we have containers which are independent to each other

=>Docker is a Containerization software
By using Docker we will create container for our applications

=>By using Docker we will create images for our applications

=>By using Docker Image we can create docker containers
and we can exceute it

=>Docker is developed in Go Language by Sebstian paul

Simply->

 container :application code + dependencies +librares

 docker :platform for packageing,deploying and run application

 docker methodology advantage is for  shipping ,deploying ,testing and run the application 



=>For Eg: In application developement (we have frontend,backend,database and the languages we use are dependencies like react js, java springbot,mysql) - they use some version and for deployment some other version so there may be version compaitibility issues


=>VIRTUALIZATION:
 
	. Using Multiple OS in the same machine

	. We use HYPERVISOR software for virtualization process

	. To overcome virtualization (compatibility version issues(like different applications has softwares which we use different versions in different applications)) we us Containerization


Host OS : 'Window OS' which is there in my laptop
	
In Host Os we can install only one version of software (for Eg:Java)


=>CONTAINERIZATION : 

	. It is used to package all the software and application code in one container for execution

	. Container will take care of everything which is required to run our application

	. We can run the containers in multiple machines
