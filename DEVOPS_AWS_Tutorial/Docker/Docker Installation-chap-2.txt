In Default User :

We install the Docker

	=>sudo yum install docker -y

Now check the docker version

	=>docker version

Client:
 Version:           20.10.23
 API version:       1.41
 Go version:        go1.18.9
 Git commit:        7155243
 Built:             Tue Apr 11 22:56:36 2023
 OS/Arch:           linux/amd64
 Context:           default
 Experimental:      true
Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?


It becomes the docker client becuase in this instance only we have installed the docker


docker deamon - It is a background server


Now check the status of the docker service

	=>sudo service docker status 

Now start the docker service

	=>sudo service docker start

Now 
	=>  docker version
(got the permission denied)

	=>sudo docker version / sudo docker info 
(we will get client and server info)

So,Everytime we need to put sudo to get client and server info

So now we no need to give the sudo to give info , so we need to add default user in docker group to get rid off permission denied error (sudo)


	=> sudo usermod -aG docker ec2-user
exit
