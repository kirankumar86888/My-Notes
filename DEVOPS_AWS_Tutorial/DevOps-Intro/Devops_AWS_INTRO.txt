DevOps + AWS Tutorial:
======================
Day 01:-5th July

AWS :

Without Cloud : May loose the Data - If any trouble occurs in Sysmtem like Crush 

With Cloud : Stored in drive and retrived

Cloud computing Delivery of computing services networks
servers,database,storage,networks,Softwares-


Renting the services from Cloud as per the usage will get the bill

Types of Cloud computing:
1.Deployment Model
2.Service Model :

Service Model :
==============
Iaas: Infrastructure as a Service
Paas :Platform as a Service
Saas:Sofftware as a Service

OnPremises - full responsibility of particular owner -like they have all servers, networking etc...
(Application,Data,Ruuntime,Middleware,Os,Virtualization,Serveers,Storage,Networking)

Iaas : Hardware as a service(Some of the services will be ours and some of the services from cloud)
(Application,Data,Ruuntime,Middleware,Os,)
(Virtualization,Serveers,Storage,Networking)
Eg :GitHub
Eg:Prepare the biryani - and buy some ingredients

Paas:
(Application,Data)
(Ruuntime,Middleware,Os,Virtualization,Serveers,Storage,Networking)
Eg:Buy the order and eat
Eg : Easy to Service, VPC Service

Saas : Fully will be managed by cloud service
(Application,Data,Ruuntime,Middleware,Os,Virtualization,Serveers,Storage,Networking)
Eg : S3 service (simple Storage Service )


Deployment Model :
================
1.Public Cloud - Is open to all yo store and access data through internet
Managed by third parties

2.Private Cloud : Internal Cloud - to build and managed their data centres
Maintained by Single Organization

3.Hybrid Cloud:
Combination of public and private cloud 
Eg: GitHub

4.Community Cloud :
Same service are sharing and using by the resources 
It allows multiple orginaztions to stotr the data
and rent the same service


Cloud Providers:
================
AWS -market share - 34%
Azure - market share -22%
google Cloud - 11%
Alibabe Cloud
IBM Cloud
Salesforce
Tencent Cloud
Oracle


AWS :  Amazon Web Services
=====
First Cloud Provider - 2006 - S3 service is provided
Intially launched - 2004 and closed and again relaunched at 2006
In 190 + countries avaiable
-200 + services are avaialble
-Pay as you go model is frequently used
Data Centre(availability zones) and Regions

In a region we have availability zones

Total:
31 Regions 
99 Availability Zones
 Most avaibility zones are in N Viriginia - are 6
Minimum availability zone required are 2
