		TEST
->Ops-
		Deploy
		Operations
		Monitoring
		Release

->IN 2012 DEVOPS is available in market

PLAN,CODE - SOURCE CODE DEVLOPMENT - GIT
BUILD - ANT,GRADLE,MAVEN tools are used
TEST

DEPLOY,OPERATE- DOCKER,ANSIBLE.. tools are used
MONITOR-NAGGIOS,SPLUNK.. tools are used

BOTH INTEGRATE - JENKINS TOOLS(CICD..Process)
