Kubernetes servie-yt-chap-5
----------------------------
Deployment->ReplicasSet->pods
Deployment wil create the replicasets and replica wil create the pods

When the container is down automaticcaly a new container created that is actually the k8s does

But problem when the acutual one does down a new container is getting created and then ip address also will get changed

For that ipaddrees get changes automatically we have a solution of Services


Deployment ->Service(it acts the load balancer)uses the component into the kubeproxy(it will forward the requestthe containers and it provieds the name of the service
->Load balancing,->Service Discovering ->Expose to world

1.Load balancing
2.Service discovering(using  labels ans selctors)

S->D->user1,user2,user3

IP address -> Labels and selectors -for evry pod get created they will apply label which is common for all the pods

service will do 
first we wil create deployment  -inside that metadata we have label
metadata;
  label
   app:payment
3.Expose to external world :
 :service can access the outside k8s cluster

Service can be created in three ways
	1.ClusterIp (by defualt brhaviour it can accesss inside the k8s cluster)benifits (loadbalancing,discobering)
	2.NodePort :With in the network /organization(have the access fo nodes cluster)
	3.LoadBalancer :it expose the application to external world-EKS->ELB-(public address)-It works on the clood platform
======================================================
1.created a deployement ,replicaset,pod (all are in  worker node 1) all yhi sdone kubernetes

2.Services will create to watch on pods

	if we craete a service as a cluster ip mode -the application is ccaeesed to the kubernetes cluster 

	if we craete load balncing type service- cluster i son aws - eks it will elastic load balamnecr ip address/public ip address -cloud control manager (it will generate the public ip address) aws ->EKs-ELB->public
User has internet access he can naccees the public aceess simply..

	If we create node type ip service -> whoever the can access the worker nodes they can access pods/applications

	If we craete cliuster type ip ->no access to any one(only they can accessto the pod)



Eg  :amazon.com :- service - load balancer
    :inside the oragazixation: service -node type
   :clusterer ip :- service - cluster ip
