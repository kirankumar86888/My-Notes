Why Ingress:
------------
What is Ingress:-
----------------
before 2015 no Ingress conecpt is there

Normally ->Deploy->replicaSet->Pod->Service

Problems in Services :
----------------------
1.Enetrprise & TLS Load Blancing(Missing these capibilities)
2.Load Balncer Type Service ->Will charge for each and evry load balamncer (for eg 1000 services for each and evertthing it will chrge)

Service ->Provide Load Blancing ->simple Round Robin Mechanism only
Expose to application to workd we use ->Type Load Blancer Mode ->as it used static public ip address- Cloud providers will charge for heavy(it is 1000

enetrprise Load Blancer ->nginx,F5-these are ratio based,sticky session,path Load Blancing,domain Load Blancing,whiltelisting Load Blancing,BlackListing Load Blancing


Now Ingress will solve this problem

create a resource called Ingress controller
