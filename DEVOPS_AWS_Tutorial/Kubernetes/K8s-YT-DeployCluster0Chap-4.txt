K8s-YT-DeployCluster-Chap-4
---------------------------
1.Kunerenetes provides- cluster,autohealing,autoscaling,enterprise
2.Instead of a container we will deploy the pod in kubernetes
pod can be a single/multiple container
pod with single container (docker run -d -port --network....for docker but all thi sare maintained in yaml of pod)
Pod -as a defination of how to run a acontainer
we have pod.yaml
->everything is written in yaml files
->pod is a group of containers or a single container
->if we put group of containers in a single a pod the advantages are -shared network, shared storage
->kubernestes does a cluster ip address to a pod but not the container(kubeproxy will generate the cluster ip address)

->kubectl is a command line for kubernetes (similarly for doker we have docker cli to run the comamnds)

->minikube,k3s...are the kunernetes cluster which are local are of free cost whereas kops is paid if u have free credits we can go with that...

->kubectl installation(go kubernetes installation website for kubectl install and check the version kubectl version)

->Now installation of local kubernetes cluster(minikube,k3s,kind,microk8s)

->We can create 100 of kubernetes cluster with kind but wheras with minikube its possible

->Install minikube(official website instalaltion steps )
(allow to create a kuberenete cluster is minikube)

->minikube start(create a one kubernetes cluster)

->minikube start --memory=4096 --driver=hyperkit(it used to cretae if morethan one cluster)

->kubectl get nodes (gives info nodes worker nodes and manager nodes)

->pod is nothing but yaml file

apiVersion : v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mynginx
spec:
  containers:
    -name:munginx
     image: nginx:latest
     ports:
      -containerPort: 80

we use in docker as below
docker run -d --name nginx -p 80:80 ngnix:latest

kubectl create -f pod.yml (pod is created)
docker ps
kubectl get pods
kubectl get pods -0 wide
login in kuberentes cluster
minikube ssh -->for real time we use like 

reference kubectl cheat sheet which all the kubernetes commands

kubectl delete pod nginx(to delete the pod)

we need to use deployment yaml file in kubernetes  which will provide the autoscaling, auto healing



Difference between container , Pod, Deployment

Container - to run the container we use like
docker run -d --name nginc -p 80:80 --network=bridge nfinx:latest

pod -Insread of thes all the we can write in yaml file (like port,voulme,network,container)
running specification is a pod
pod can have a single or multiple container(in multiple container they can shre the network)

Deployment- autohealing and autoscaling behaviour  becuase of this we go for deployment (end of this it is a pod only)
Deployment will have the ReplicaSet which is a kubernetes comtroller
End of this it wil create Pod only

Difference between Deployment and Replicaset

replicaset - a kuberentes controller it does the auto healing feature

Deployment :when we create deployment it will create the replicaset and does actual state in deployemnt should be same in the cluster (yaml file to actual)
