Kubernetes :
------------

Difference between Docker and Kubernetes

	1.Docker is container platfom (Ephermeral in nature)
	2.Kubernetes is  a container orachestration platform



Problems in Docker :
=======================
1.Sigle host of nature of your docker Container :
 
Containers are epherminal nature(short life span)-Conatiiner 1 occupies more memory so other container may die baecuase one of the container mainly becuase of single host

2. Auto healing:
If Some one kills the container , the application in the container is not accessible

Auto healing - without user manual intervention - your container start by itself

3.Auto scaling :

for example we have created a container and has 4CPU and 4GB
Manually you increase the same type of containers to 100 containers when there is a heavy load
Now Load balaacer need to automatically increase the container when there is heavy load

4.Docker is a simple platform

	Docker does not provide Enetrprise Level suppport(Load balancer ,firewall ,Auto scaling ,Auto healing ,Api gateways...)


Here all four problems 
	1.Single host
	2.Auto Healing
	3.Auto Scaling
	4.Enterprise
All these problems can be solved by Kubernetes

	how the Kubernetes solves these problems

1. Kubernetes installed as Cluster(Master Node or slave nodes)
	If there is faulting node which is imapcting the other cotaienr it automatically keeps the other container in soome other node

	2.Auto scaling : Kubernetes has the Replication Controller - Replication contaienr yaml , whenever there is a load just incraese the containers

	3.Autohealing :Kubernetes controls and fix the damage - One of your container is down - Kubernetes ha s the auto healing feauture - When the container go down , it will rollout the new container(so user even doesnt know the container is down)

	4.Enterprise - Kubernetes has Enterprise feature(has fire wall support,Load balancing,advance Networking..)
