Ansible:is a configuration management tool
main components are in ansible Playbooks
Ansible was written in python 
agent less architecture
push base mechanism
using script is YAML---yet another markup language
it have n no of modules using python 
Ansible GUI--Ansible Tower(Drag and drop)
inventory file required to config ansible
acm and targetnode connection will be as ssh


cheff/puppet---pull base mechanism and agent based/cook books/DSLscript(domain specific language/groovy script)


sudo amazon-linux-extras install ansible2 -y
yum install git python-pip-level openssl -y

vi /etc/ansible/host
add group name and ip address of node servers
[dev]
privateip1
privateip2
:wq

open 
vi /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

inventory 
sudo_root   uncomment the both inventory and sudo root
:wq

useradding
useradd ansible
passwd ansible

visudo
add user at allow any user
ansible and NOPASSWD: ALL
:wq
vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
password authentication give it as yes
:wq

connect target node
sudo -i
useradd ansible
passwd ansible
visudo
allow root all
add user credentials
vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
:wq
systemctl restart sshd in all instances

go to master
su - ansible

go to nodes
su - ansible for all nodes

sudo vim /etc/ansible/hosts

ansible all --list-hosts
ansible all -a "ls"

in master server
ssh-keygen
copy key

Ansibel-dhoc Commands:to perfom quicklyperations and it performs single tasks
it can be run indivisually to perform quick popearations
these are temporary commands
modules are shippable commands

ansible groupname -m(module) ping(module) -o(output)------it display the result in single line
ex:ansible DEV -m ping -o
or ansible privateip of ec2 -m ping -o

ansible all -m shell -a date
ansible all -m shell -a uptime

Modules:
ping----->to check the connectivity
shell---->execute the commands
yum----->package s/w install and uninstall  state=present
copy---->copy the files
service---->service start
command---->commands in linux



state=present----->install package
state=absent----->uninstall package
state=latest---->update package
state=started---->to start the service

ex:ansible dev -m yum -a "name=git state=present" --become
ansible dev -m service -a "name=git state=present" --become
ansible dev -m copy -a "src=/home/ansible/index.html dest=/var/www/html" --become
ansible dev -m ansible.builtin.shell -a "echo 'New content to add' >> /home/ansible/file"




ansible groupname -a "ls"
ansible all -m ping 
ansible all -m ping -o


empty in ansible server

target node server to copy

ansible my_remote_node -m ansible.builtin.shell/lineinfile(only one line) -a "echo 'New content to add' >> /path/to/remote/file"------->add content in to that file from ansible server
ansible <target_host> -m shell -a "ansible localhost -m blockinfile -a 'path=/path/to/remote/file block='''Your Content Block''' insertbefore=^marker$'"

ANSIBLE PLYABOOKS:

Playbooks are written in YAML(yet another markup language) Language
extension should be .yml or .yaml
each playbook is composed of one or more modules in a list
module is collection of configuarations
we will use playbooks to write set of task those tasks should be performed by ansible
playbook contains a list of tasks and task contains a list of modules
module will execute entire playbook


yaml starts with three ---(hyphen) symbols and end with three ... (dots)
playbooks compose with different sections
what are they
1.host section------>defines the target machines on which playbooks should be run
2.variable section---->based on our required we use this varibale section and this is optional section and can declare all the variables when need in playbooks
3.task section------->it list out the all the tasks that should be executed on the target machine and it specifiy the use of modules and every task having name which give description 


Playbook commands

ansible-playbook playbokkname----->to run playbook
ansible-playbook plyabookname --syntax-check---->to verify the perfect sytnatx and indendation
ansible-playbook playbookname --check----->it is (dry run) command it performs 
ansible-playbook playbookname-v-------/>display small information 
ansible-playbook playbookname-vv------>display of huge amount of information
ansible-playbook playbookname-vvv---->very huge amount of inform
